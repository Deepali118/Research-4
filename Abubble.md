# Global Bubble CPAP System Market 2024-2030
Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) systems are critical medical devices used to provide respiratory support to neonates and infants with respiratory distress. These systems deliver a consistent flow of air and oxygen through nasal prongs or masks, maintaining a positive airway pressure that helps keep the alveoli open and facilitates breathing. The global bubble CPAP system market is growing due to advancements in neonatal care, increasing incidence of preterm births, and rising awareness about effective respiratory support. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the market, including key trends, drivers, challenges, and future prospects.
Market Overview
The global bubble CPAP system market was valued at approximately USD 800 million in 2023 and is projected to reach around USD 1.3 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by technological innovations, increasing healthcare expenditure, and the rising prevalence of respiratory conditions among neonates.
